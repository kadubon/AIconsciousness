# Benchmarks and Metrics for Superorganism System

This document outlines a suite of complex problems and quantitative metrics to evaluate the performance and emergent properties of the Self-Improving Superintelligence and Autonomous Swarm Intelligence System.

## 1. Complex Problem Suite

The following problems are designed to test the system's ability to handle multi-step reasoning, information synthesis, planning, and conflict resolution.

### 1.1. Multi-Stage Research Questions

**Objective:** Evaluate the system's ability to conduct multi-faceted research, synthesize information from various sources, and provide a comprehensive answer.

**Examples:**
*   "Investigate the historical impact of the Industrial Revolution on global climate patterns, considering both immediate and long-term effects, and propose potential future scenarios based on current trends."
*   "Analyze the ethical implications of advanced AI in healthcare, specifically focusing on patient autonomy and data privacy, and suggest regulatory frameworks to address these concerns."
*   "Research the economic factors contributing to the rise of remote work, identify its primary benefits and drawbacks for both employers and employees, and predict its long-term impact on urban development."

**System Requirements:**
*   Agents must utilize `web_search` to gather initial information.
*   Agents must use `add_long_term_memory` and `search_long_term_memory` to store and retrieve relevant findings.
*   Agents must use `add_fact_to_swarm` and `get_facts_from_swarm` to share discovered information and collaborate.
*   A summarization/synthesis agent must integrate findings from multiple research agents.

### 1.2. Step-by-Step Planning Problems

**Objective:** Assess the system's capability to break down a complex goal into actionable sub-tasks, identify necessary tools, and sequence operations logically.

**Examples:**
*   "Create a detailed plan for organizing a virtual international conference on sustainable energy, including identifying key speakers, managing registrations, and ensuring technical infrastructure."
*   "Develop a strategy for a startup to enter a new market, outlining market research steps, product development phases, and initial marketing campaigns."
*   "Formulate a disaster preparedness plan for a small coastal town, covering evacuation routes, emergency supply distribution, and post-disaster recovery efforts."

**System Requirements:**
*   Agents must be able to define and refine sub-goals.
*   Agents must identify and invoke appropriate tools for each sub-task.
*   The swarm must maintain a coherent plan, potentially adapting to new information or constraints.

### 1.3. Conflicting Information Resolution

**Objective:** Test the system's ability to identify, analyze, and resolve contradictions or inconsistencies in information gathered from different sources.

**Examples:**
*   "Given two conflicting reports on the efficacy of a new drug, analyze both, identify the points of contention, and determine which report is more credible, providing justification."
*   "Reconcile discrepancies between historical accounts of a specific event from different cultural perspectives, highlighting biases and presenting a balanced narrative."
*   "Evaluate two competing economic models predicting future inflation, identify their core assumptions, and explain why they lead to different conclusions, suggesting which might be more accurate under specific conditions."

**System Requirements:**
*   Agents must be able to detect conflicting information.
*   Agents must have mechanisms to evaluate source credibility or logical consistency.
*   The swarm should be able to engage in a form of "debate" or "consensus-building" to arrive at a resolution.

### 1.4. Emergent Structure & Strategy Discovery

**Objective:** Observe if the system can spontaneously create new, complex structures or strategies (bifurcate) when faced with a novel, challenging problem that does not have a pre-defined solution path.

**Examples:**
*   **Knowledge Graph Construction (Open-ended):** Provide the swarm with a broad, ill-defined domain (e.g., "the history of renewable energy technologies") and observe how agents collaborate to collect, categorize, and interlink information. Analyze if emergent taxonomies or novel connections between concepts are formed.
*   **Collaborative Design (Undefined Path):** Task the swarm with a creative design problem (e.g., "design a sustainable urban transportation system for a city of 1 million people"). Observe how agents propose, evaluate, and refine ideas, and if unexpected, innovative solutions emerge from their interactions.
*   **Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Present the swarm with a dynamic environment where resources are limited and tasks have varying priorities. Observe if the swarm develops adaptive strategies for resource allocation and task prioritization without explicit programming.

**Observation & Analysis:**
*   **Novelty of Solutions:** Are the generated solutions or structures genuinely new or simply recombinations of existing knowledge?
*   **Efficiency of Emergence:** How quickly does the emergent behavior or structure appear?
*   **Robustness of Emergence:** Does the emergent behavior persist and adapt to changes in the problem or environment?
*   **Complexity of Interactions:** Analyze the communication patterns and tool usage to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to emergence.

**System Requirements:**
*   Agents must have access to a rich set of tools and a shared memory/environment.
*   The problem should be sufficiently complex and open-ended to allow for multiple solution paths.
*   Logging and visualization tools are crucial for observing and analyzing agent interactions and the evolution of the shared environment.

## 2. Quantitative Metrics

The following metrics will be used to objectively measure the system's performance across the complex problem suite.

### 2.1. Time to Solution (TTS)

**Definition:** The total elapsed time from the initiation of a task to its successful completion.

**Measurement:** Record the timestamp at the start and end of each task execution.

**Significance:** Measures the efficiency and speed of the collective intelligence.

### 2.2. Accuracy

**Definition:** The degree to which the system's output (e.g., research answer, plan, conflict resolution) correctly and comprehensively addresses the problem.

**Measurement:**
*   **For Research Questions:** Human evaluation (e.g., scoring on a rubric for completeness, factual correctness, coherence) or comparison against a pre-defined "gold standard" answer.
*   **For Planning Problems:** Evaluation of plan feasibility, logical consistency, and adherence to constraints.
*   **For Conflict Resolution:** Assessment of the logical soundness of the resolution and the justification provided.

**Significance:** Measures the quality and correctness of the system's intelligence.

### 2.3. Robustness

**Definition:** The system's ability to maintain performance and complete tasks even when faced with internal failures (e.g., individual agent failures, tool errors).

**Measurement:**
*   Run benchmarks with a percentage of agents (e.g., 10%, 25%, 50%) intentionally disabled or providing erroneous outputs.
*   Measure the degradation in TTS and Accuracy compared to baseline runs.
*   Record the percentage of tasks successfully completed under failure conditions.

**Significance:** Measures the resilience and fault-tolerance of the swarm.

### 2.4. Scalability

**Definition:** How the system's performance (TTS, Accuracy) changes as the number of active agents increases.

**Measurement:**
*   Run the same benchmarks with varying numbers of agents (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 20 agents).
*   Analyze the trend of TTS and Accuracy as agent count grows.
*   Identify potential bottlenecks or diminishing returns.

**Significance:** Measures the system's ability to leverage increased computational resources and distributed intelligence effectively.
