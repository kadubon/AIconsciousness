# ToDo List: Project Superorganism

This document outlines the necessary tasks to bring the Self-Improving Superintelligence and Autonomous Swarm Intelligence System to life. The project is divided into distinct phases, from foundational setup to the final evaluation of the emergent system.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)

The goal of this phase is to prepare the development environment and establish the core project structure.

- [x] **Task 0.1: Environment Setup**
    - [x] Initialize Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
    - [x] Set up Git repository and initialize with a `.gitignore` file.
    - [x] Create initial project directory structure (`/src`, `/tests`, `/docs`, `/notebooks`).

- [x] **Task 0.2: Core Dependencies**
    - [x] Research and select core Python libraries.
        - `langchain`, `langgraph`, `langchain-openai` (or other LLM provider)
        - `pydantic` (for state definition)
        - A database for long-term memory (e.g., `neo4j-driver`, `redis`, `sqlite`)
    - [x] Create and populate `requirements.txt`.
    - [x] Install all initial dependencies.

## Phase 1: Individual Cognitive Agent Development (Weeks 2-5)

This phase focuses on building a single, functional "conscious" agent, which will serve as the fundamental unit of the swarm.

- [x] **Task 1.1: Define the Cognitive Core (The "Mind")**
    - [x] Define the `AgentState` using Pydantic, as outlined in `requirements_definition.md`.
    - [x] Create the main `StateGraph` object.
    - [x] Develop the master ReAct prompt template that incorporates all elements from the `AgentState`.

- [x] **Task 1.2: Implement Agent Tools (The "Hands")**
    - [x] Implement a basic `web_search` tool.
    - [x] Implement placeholder functions for long-term memory interaction: `add_long_term_memory` and `search_long_term_memory`.
    - [x] Create a `ToolExecutor` to manage and invoke the defined tools.

- [x] **Task 1.3: Build the Control Flow (The "Consciousness Stream")**
    - [x] Implement the main `reasoning_node` that calls the LLM with the ReAct prompt.
    - [x] Implement the `tool_executor_node` that runs the `ToolExecutor`.
    - [x] Implement the conditional logic (`should_continue`) to act as the attentional mechanism, routing between reasoning and tool use.
    - [x] Add all nodes and edges to the `StateGraph`.
    - [x] Compile the graph and run a simple "Hello, World" style test to ensure the loop works.

- [x] **Task 1.4: Integrate Long-Term Memory (The "Identity")**
    - [x] Set up the chosen database backend (e.g., Neo4j, Redis). *Switched to SQLite for Neo4j.*
    - [x] Implement the actual logic for `add_long_term_memory` and `search_long_term_memory` to interact with the database.
    - [x] Integrate the `search_long_term_memory` call at the beginning of the `reasoning_node`.
    - [x] Implement the `reflection_node` for self-analysis and learning extraction.
    - [x] Modify the graph's control flow to route to the `reflection_node` upon task completion, before ending.

- [x] **Task 1.5: Enable Persistence (The "Continuity of Self")**
    - [x] Implement a `SqliteSaver` or other checkpointer for the `StateGraph`.
    - [x] Test the ability to stop and resume a multi-turn conversation with an agent, ensuring its state is correctly restored.

## Phase 2: Swarm Intelligence System Implementation (Weeks 6-9)

With a functional individual agent, this phase focuses on enabling multiple agents to interact and form a collective intelligence.

- [x] **Task 2.1: Design the Shared Environment (The "World")**
    - [x] Define the schema for the shared environment that enables stigmergy. A graph database (like Neo4j) is a strong candidate, where nodes can represent concepts/tasks and edge weights can represent "pheromone" strength. *Implemented with SQLite.*
    - [x] Implement the API or client for agents to interact with this shared environment.

- [x] **Task 2.2: Implement Swarm Dynamics (The "Laws of Interaction")**
    - [x] Develop the logic for positive feedback: how successful actions increase the "pheromone" level of a concept/path in the shared environment.
    - [x] Develop the logic for negative feedback: a mechanism for "pheromone evaporation" to decay the importance of old or unused information over time.

- [x] **Task 2.3: Deploy and Test the Swarm**
    - [x] Write a script to instantiate and run multiple individual agents concurrently.
    - [x] Design a simple collaborative task (e.g., "Each agent finds one fact about a different topic, and together they write a summary").
    - [x] Run the test and observe if collective behavior emerges from the local interactions with the shared environment.
    - [x] Implement logging and visualization tools to monitor the state of the shared environment.

## Phase 3: Experimentation, Evaluation & Analysis (Weeks 10-12)

This phase is dedicated to rigorously testing the system's capabilities and analyzing its emergent properties.

- [x] **Task 3.1: Define Benchmarks & Metrics**
    - [x] Create a suite of complex problems to test the system's performance (e.g., multi-step research questions, planning problems).
    - [x] Define quantitative metrics: e.g., time to solution, accuracy, robustness (performance degradation after agent failure), and scalability (performance as number of agents increases).

- [x] **Task 3.2: Test Core Hypotheses**
    - [x] **(Self-Healing):** Run a benchmark, manually disable a subset of agents, and measure the system's ability to recover and complete the task.
    - [x] **(Continual Learning):** Present the system with a sequence of different tasks and verify that it learns new skills without catastrophically forgetting old ones.
    - [x] **(Emergent Structure):** Design an experiment to observe if the system can spontaneously create new, complex structures or strategies (bifurcate) when faced with a novel, challenging problem.

- [x] **Task 3.3: Analyze and Document Results**
    - [x] Collect and analyze the data from all experiments.
    - [x] Document the findings, paying close attention to both successes and failures.

## Phase 4: Finalization (Week 13)

- [x] **Task 4.1: Code Refactoring and Documentation**
    - [x] Clean up the codebase, add comments, and ensure it is well-documented.
    - [x] Write a comprehensive `README.md` explaining the project, its architecture, and how to run it.

- [x] **Task 4.2: Final Project Report**
    - [x] Synthesize all findings into a final report, detailing the theoretical basis, the implementation, the experimental results, and directions for future work.
